## Indicative marking guide 2021

The list below aims to provide an indication of the kinds of features required for each marking boundary.
The final grade awarded will depend upon the exact combination and features and how well they have been implemented.
If you skip some features in lower bands, but implement others in higher bands, marking will take the overall achievement profile into account.
If you want to be certain of achieving a grade within a particular band, the safest thing to do is to implement all the features in the preceding bands !

**In order to get a pass mark (40%) you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the following**:
- OBJ geometry file loading
- Wireframe rendering
- Keyboard control of camera position
- Export of image files and creation of animated video

**To get a mark in the 40s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the above features as well as SOME of the following**:
- OBJ material file loading
- Flat shaded triangle rasterising
- Basic texture mapping
- Simple animation (e.g. fly-through, simple translation of model elements etc.)

**To get a mark in the 50s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the above features as well as SOME of the following**:
- Hard Shadow
- Ambient lighting
- Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)
- Changing camera orientation (using orientation matrix)

**To get a mark in the 60s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the above features as well as SOME of the following**:
- Gouraud shading
- Reflective materials (e.g. mirrors, metal etc.)
- Specular lighting
- More complex animation (e.g. articulation or multi-waypoint camera tracking)

**To get a mark in the low 70s you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the above features as well as SOME of the following**:
- Phong Shading
- Realistic soft shadows
- Refractive materials (e.g. glass, water etc.)
- Creative and sophisticated animation

**To get 75 and above you must _convincingly_ implement ALL of the above features as well as SOME of the following**:
- Bump maps
- Environment maps (for use with reflective materials)
- Photon maps and caustics
- VERY creative and sophisticated animation
