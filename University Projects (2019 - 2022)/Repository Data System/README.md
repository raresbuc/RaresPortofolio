# SPE-SPEAC

### Vision
An application that provides charts and reports in the SPE MS Teams group.

### Motivation
SPEAC sits at the top of a stack of new tools that will ultimately provide up-to-date insight into the progress of the SPE groups via MS Teams and other tools. SPEAC will upload GH analytics data (graphs and tables) from the GH Analytics & Metrics (GHAM) server to MS Teams.

### Main Functionality
SPEAC will use the MS Graph API to interact with MS Teams. Itâ€™s main functionality will be in the java SPEAC-lib. The project will also produce a long-running SPEAC-server application that uses the SPEAC lib. The library will be used by the GHAM server. The server application will demonstrate the use of the SPEAC-lib.
