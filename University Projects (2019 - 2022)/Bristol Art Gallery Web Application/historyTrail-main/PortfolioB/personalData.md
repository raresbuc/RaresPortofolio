# Personal Data, Privacy, Security and Ethics Management

In order to improve our users’ experience, we have added a ‘favourites’ button. As a result, the only personal data collected is the user’s favourite museum objects,
which will be stored on the user’s personal device through the use of first-party, functional cookies (they will not be shared with external parties and will only be
stored on the user’s device). We have therefore taken measures to comply with the PECR cookie law. In particular, our web app will only collect cookies if the user
explicitly permits it. If the user chooses not to do so, they will not be able to use the ‘favourites’ functionality, but all other functionality will still be accessible.
Users can also access our cookie policy, in which more information can be found about the type of cookies used, how they are used and how to revoke consent. In order to comply
with GDPR, our cookies expire after 1 year and must be renewed for further use.

Our web app will also display the museum’s most liked objects. This is done by storing aggregated data and so data protection laws do not apply, as the data is anonymous. The
nature of our web app means that no other personal data is collected and as such, no other GDPR rules apply.

As we want this app to be accessible to everyone, we have taken measures to ensure that the web app is compatible with the devices’ accessibility features.
We have ensured that our code is well-structured and have provided alt text for all images, so that users with visual impairment would be able to use their devices’ screen reader.
