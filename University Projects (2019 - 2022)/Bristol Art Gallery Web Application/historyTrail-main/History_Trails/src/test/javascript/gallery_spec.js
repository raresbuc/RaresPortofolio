She has turned her face to the right and gazes into the distance. Her long coral bead necklace with its gilt cross pendant stands out from her white shirt. Striving to achieve recognition and success at the Paris Salon, Thomas Couture produced a number of large, complex compositions in the grand tradition. By contrast, this more intimate painting demonstrates the more spontaneous side of his nature. It is one of a number of studies which Couture made of the strolling Italian players who passed by his home at Villiers-le-Bel in 1877. Couture was a popular and influential teacher in Paris and encouraged his pupils to retain the qualities of the sketch, such as pure colour and fresh brushwork, in their finished paintings. Among his pupils were Edouard Manet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and several American artists.");

The artist and his uncle Giovanni Antonio Canal, commonly called Canaletto, collected motifs from the atmospheric Lagoon on a trip to Padua in 1741.
